# Simple-Form-With-Api

My first app with Fetch.

Description:

Simple application fetching data by userId, Id and/or both.
filtering result is given to "preview" and "every search list" section
I used Bootstrap and a little css to style app.
In js modules I tried to figure out the most readable, not much repetitive code
and hope helping names for easy application review.
